How to FrankenCap

MODEL STEPS:
1) Video processing:
	- shorten it (if desired)
	- improve its readability (different encoding techniques)
	- sync the videos (using audio sync)
2) Pose detection
	- run OpenPose on each video to extract 2D keypoints
		- select the person of interest (bounding-box mechanism)
3) Triangulate
	- 2D to 3D keypoint position (save as a pickle file)
4) 3D filtering
	- low-pass (Butterworth, fc=10, numtaps=31)
	- filter by velocity (based on velocity z-score, threshold=3.0)
	- interpolate (spline, # of frames = 60, 2s equivalent)
	- pattern-based filling (offset-based, # of frames to use before/after = 5)
		* Nose to REye
		* Nose to LEye
		* Neck to LShoulder
		* Neck to RShoulder
		* RShoulder to RElbow
		* RElbow to RWrist
		* LShoulder to LElbow
		* LElbow to LWrist
	- another low-pass (Butterworth, fc=10, numtaps=31)
	- rotate keypoints to match the OpenSim convention
	- estimate hip positions (hip offset = 0.25*height)
	- save as .trc
5) Marker augmentation
	- OpenCap's LSTM to estimate extra elbow and wrist positions)
6) Model scaling
	- OpenSim model scaling based on the most static segment of the video
7) Inverse kinematics
	- OpenSim IK function on the scaled model using the augmented TRC
